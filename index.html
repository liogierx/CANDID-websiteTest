  <h1>What is CANDID?</h1>
  <p>End of 2021, the Loulou Foundation, announced that seven biopharmaceutical industry partners, together with the Loulou Foundation, had formed  a pre-competitive consortium to direct a key clinical study for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for CDKL5 Deficiciency Disorder (CDD). The seven companes are <strong>Amicus Therapeutics</strong>; <strong>Biogen Inc.</strong>; <strong>Elaaj Bio</strong>; <strong>Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.</strong>; <strong>PTC Therapeutics</strong>; and Zogenix Inc. (now <strong>UCB</strong>). The seven partners share the funding and governance of a 3-year observational study with CDD patients, called <strong>CANDID</strong>. The Loulou Foundation serves as the study coordinator.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The CANDID study is an international, observational study for CDD patients. The purpose of this study is to identify the best motor, cognitive and behavioral clinic measures in assessing their suitability (e.g., feasibility, floor/ceiling effects) with CDD patients, and their adaptability across a variety of countries and languages for future international clinical trials. We prioritized the use of already known scales and measures with regulatory precedent in similar contexts as this may allow future sponsors to expedite drug development in CDD. These selected measures will be administered on a number of occasions and will assess a wide range of skills including cognitive performance, behavior, global functioning, as well as the parent’s perception of their child’s independence and quality of life. This type of study will help de-risk a broader assessment selection for early and late phase clinical trials.

As an observational study (and not interventional), participants are followed over several months during which they continue to receive their usual medications and specific care. <br>
More details on the study can be found on clinicaltrials.gov: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05373719?term=NCT05373719&rank=1" target="_blank">NCT05373719</a>
  
  <h1>How does the CANDID study work?</h1>
  <p>Participants with CDD and parents/caregivers who consented to be part of the study have had a first visit at their clinic, called baseline visit. During this visit, clinical assessments are performed on the participant, by a healthcare professional. Also, parents/caregivers are asked to fill out several questionnaires and go through a couple of clinical interviews. The follow-up study visits consist in either on-site visits or remote visits (done over the phone).
  </p> <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
Currently, the study is planned for 3 years after the baseline visit.

  <h1>Where are our study sites located?</h1>
  <p>This is a multi-site, multi-country study. Overall, CANDID involves 22 clinical centers from 7 countries: <br> </p>

  <h1>Study update as of January 2024</h1>
  <p>Enrollment was achieved in approximately 1 year, with 112 participants. Demographics, baseline characteristics, and baseline scale results were presented at the <a href="AES2024_Poster_Liogier.pdf" target="_blank">2024 AES congress</a>. </p>

  <p>Additional results will be summarized in this section when available.</p>
